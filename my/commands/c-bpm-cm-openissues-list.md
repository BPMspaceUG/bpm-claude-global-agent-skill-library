# /c-bpm-cm-openissues-list — Open Issues Dashboard

Show all open GitHub Issues for the current repository in a compact table. If milestones are missing from the repo, set them up and enforce the lifecycle in CLAUDE.md.

$ARGUMENTS

---

## Step 1 — Identify Repository

```bash
git remote -v | head -1
```

Extract the **OWNER** and **REPO** from the remote URL. Use these for ALL subsequent calls.

## Step 2 — Check Milestones in GitHub Repo

List existing milestone titles (compact output):

```bash
gh api 'repos/{OWNER}/{REPO}/milestones?per_page=100&state=all' --jq '.[].title' | sort
```

The full lifecycle requires these milestones:

| Milestone | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `new` | Issue created, not yet planned |
| `planned` | Agent submitted a plan |
| `plan-approved` | Team Lead + Codex both approved the plan |
| `test-designed` | Agent submitted test design |
| `test-design-approved` | Team Lead + Codex both approved test design |
| `implemented` | Code written, agent reports completion |
| `tested-success` | All tests pass |
| `tested-failed` | Tests fail — bounces back with documented reason |
| `test-approved` | Final automated gate — independent verification passed |
| `DONE` | Human-only final sign-off |

### If ANY milestones are missing:

1. **Create the missing milestones** via `gh api`:

   ```bash
   gh api repos/{OWNER}/{REPO}/milestones -f title="<name>" -f description="<description>"
   ```

   Skip milestones that already exist. Create only what's missing.

2. **Update the local CLAUDE.md** — check if the file already contains a `## Mandatory: Milestone-Based Issue Lifecycle` section. If it does NOT exist, append the following section to the end of CLAUDE.md:

   ```markdown
   ## Mandatory: Milestone-Based Issue Lifecycle

   **All issues in this repo MUST follow the milestone-based lifecycle. No exceptions.**

   Every issue gets exactly ONE milestone at a time representing its current state. Milestones are progressed in order — no skipping states.

   ### Lifecycle Flow

   ```
   new -> planned -> plan-approved -> test-designed -> test-design-approved
     -> implemented -> tested-success / tested-failed -> test-approved -> DONE
   ```

   ### Non-Negotiable Rules

   1. **One milestone at a time** per issue — no skipping states
   2. **Dual approval required** at every gate — Team Lead AND Codex must both approve
   3. **`DONE` is human-only** — agents must NEVER set this milestone
   4. **One issue per discrete change** — all phases documented as comments on that issue
   5. **Audit trail** — every Codex response posted as comment on the GitHub Issue
   6. **On failure**: `tested-failed` bounces back to `planned` (wrong approach) or `implemented` (code bug), with documented reason
   7. **Run `/c-bpm-cm-openissues-list` before any issue-related work** to check status and milestones
   ```

   If the section already exists, do NOT duplicate it.

3. **Report what was done:**
   ```
   Created milestones: new, planned, plan-approved, ... (list only the ones created)
   CLAUDE.md updated with mandatory milestone lifecycle section
   ```

### If ALL milestones already exist:

Display:
```
All lifecycle milestones exist in the repo.
```

## Step 3 — Fetch Open Issues (compact)

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT use GitHub MCP `list_issues` — it returns full issue bodies and wastes context.

Use `gh api` with `--jq` to fetch ONLY the fields needed for the table:

```bash
gh api 'repos/{OWNER}/{REPO}/issues?state=open&per_page=100' \
  --jq '.[] | select(.pull_request == null) | [.number, .title, (.labels | map(.name) | join(",")), (.milestone.title // "—")] | @tsv'
```

This returns one TSV line per issue with: number, title, labels, milestone.

If more than 100 issues, paginate with `&page=2`, `&page=3`, etc.

**NEVER use `-f` flags with GET endpoints** — `-f` triggers a POST request. Always pass parameters as URL query strings for GET requests.

## Step 4 — Display Table

Render a markdown table with these columns:

| # | Title | Type | Milestone |
|---|-------|------|-----------|

- **#** — Issue number (e.g., `#33`)
- **Title** — Issue title as plain text (NOT a URL link)
- **Type** — From labels: `bug`, `enhancement`, etc. — or `—` if none
- **Milestone** — Current milestone name, or `—` if none

Sort by issue number ascending.

After the table, show a summary line:
```
N open issue(s) | M with milestones | K without milestones
```

## Step 5 — Final Status

### If ALL issues have milestones:
```
All open issues have milestones assigned. Lifecycle is on track.
```

### If ANY issues lack milestones:
```
{K} issue(s) have no milestone assigned.
Milestones are available — assign them via GitHub or `/c-bpm-sk-milestone-type`.
```

## Notes

- Show issue titles as readable text, NEVER as clickable URLs
- If there are no open issues, say: "No open issues found for OWNER/REPO."
- The command creates milestones and updates CLAUDE.md only when milestones don't exist yet
- It does NOT auto-assign milestones to individual issues — that's a Team Lead decision
- **All data fetching uses `gh api` with `--jq`** — never GitHub MCP (too verbose)
- **All GET requests use URL query params** — never `-f` flags (which trigger POST)
